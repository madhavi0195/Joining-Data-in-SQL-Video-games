# Joining-Data-in-SQL-Video-games

Hello, This project is part of the DataCamp course, Data Analyst in SQL which I've completed few months back. you can find the project details below to get more idea!

Project Name: When was the golden Age of video games?

Task: Use joins and set theory to discover the best years for video games!

Project Description:
In this project, I'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I'll also filter, group, and order data.

Technology: SQL
